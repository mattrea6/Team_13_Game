Team 13's Text Based game


Rapping Game Ideas
1: Game has multiple rappers in their own rooms.
2: User “raps” against these rappers in battles, earning special items if they win.
3: The battles are basically where you have to enter a certain input within a certain amount of time. This time determines the difficulty of the battle. 
4: Having more items makes battles easier, making the later battles doable.
5: Once the final, hardest rapper is beaten, the game is won

What needs made:
1: timer (where the battle/input happens) - Joe
2: Names rooms and items changed-  Frank, Adrian, Sebastian
3: List of lines- Adrian
4: Function of the battle- Joe
5: Add attribute to items for increasing time to rap.-  
6: Edit parser and execution functions for rap battles. - Matt

Extra ideas (later):
1: Experience
2: Studio to gain experience

time function:
